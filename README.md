## About WIAD22

The 2022 World IA Day events, henceforth WIAD22, mark the 11th year of World IA Day celebrations all over the world. 

You are currently viewing the project repository where information and discussions for and with event organizers and the WIAD22 planning team take place.

Our goal for this repository is to provide all the information and assets that volunteers need for their local events. This also means that everyone watching or following this repository for WIAD22 has the "responsibility of reproducibility" to make the information for volunteers planning WIAD22 more clear, efficient, effective, and valuable.
