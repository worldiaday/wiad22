# WIAD22 - A connected world
The global theme for 2022 World IA Day is "A connected world"

We connect with each other in digital, physical, and blended spaces. We connect with people, products, services, content, and the world in general. This connectedness can be wondrous and yet challenging. 

Information architecture uncovers and creates new connections that we weren't aware of before. It can inspire us to make new discoveries or reveal new relationships that may urge us to take constructive action, e.g. climate change, the global health crisis, or the supply chain disruption we have experienced during the pandemic. Information literacy and information architecture may help us in our understanding, such as searching and differentiating which information is important or trustworthy. Clarity can help reduce the spread of disinformation and fake news. It allows us to steer better regarding who and what we are connecting with. It creates spaces we enjoy being in.

In a world where weâ€™re connected yet distanced, how do you facilitate connectedness? How do you help make sense of connections? What new connections have you made recently? How did you support others to discover new connections? In what ways do you think information and information architecture can be used to support, define, or create environments (digital, physical, virtual, or blended) to improve the lives and experiences of people in a connected world? Share with us your thoughts, ideas, experiences, and learnings.
