# WIAD22 - A connected world: Finding new ways to connect
The global theme for 2022 World IA Day is "A connected world: Finding new ways to connect"

We connect with each other in digital, physical, and blended spaces. We connect with people, services, content, and the world in general. This connectedness can be wondrous and yet challenging. 

Information architecture uncovers and creates new connections that we weren't aware of before. It can inspire us to make new discoveries or reveal new relationships that urge us to take action, e.g. climate change or the supply chain disruption we have experienced during the pandemic. Information architecture contributes to making connections more relevant. It helps us understand which information is important and trustworthy. It provides guidance in a mess of information and helps fight against the disinformation of fake news. It allows us to steer better who and what we are connecting with. It creates places we enjoy being in where people and information meet.

In a world where weâ€™re connected yet distanced, how do you facilitate connectedness? How do you help make sense of connections? What new connections have you made recently? How did you support others to discover new connections? How do you relate or consider information architecture to define all these (digital, physical, virtual, and blended) environments? Tell us about your experiences to inspire us and to demonstrate the power of information architecture!
